# Campaign-Business-Report
Kickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects, operating through the “crowdfunding” model. The company was founded in 2009 and has been the jump-start for products such as:

“Exploding Kittens” card game
“Oculus” (Oculus rift)
Crowdfunding
Crowdfunding works by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people to gain capital for a project.
It is considered a form of alternative finance, and is often done via the internet.
It is similar to donating to a charity online, or pledging a friend to run in a race. Typically, donators (backers) get a predetermined reward, or gift in exchange for their money.
The rewards usually increase in value as the amount donated increases.
How Kickstarter Campaigns Work
Every creator sets their project's funding goal and deadline.
If the project reaches its funding goal, all backers' credit cards are charged on the deadline.
Funding on Kickstarter uses an all-or-nothing model. If the project falls short of its funding goal, no one is charged, and the project receives ZERO funding.
Kickstarter cannot be used to offer financial returns or equity, or to solicit loans.
